# introduction_to_Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch


Welcome to the Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch! This project is intended to provide a basic understanding of deep learning and its implementation using PyTorch.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Go to the PyTorch website (https://pytorch.org/) and select the appropriate version of PyTorch based on your system configuration and requirements. 

You can install these packages using pip, the Python package manager:

``` pip install pandas numpy matplotlib```

## Project Structure 

This project contains the following files:

- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- Introduction_to_Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to deep learning and its implementation using PyTorch.

## Example Implementation

The Introduction_to_Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch.ipynb notebook contains an example implementation of a simple neural network using PyTorch. 

The notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to build and train the neural network using PyTorch, as well as how to evaluate its performance on the test dataset.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the Deep Learning Specialization on Datacamp, taught by Mahan Khan.
